Symphony Installation
=====================

Installing Symphony on a rig
----------------------------

To run Symphony on an e-phys rig you need the following items installed:

* Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)
* MultiClamp Commander (available from http://mdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/18877)
* Symphony .NET Framework (available from http://download.physionconsulting.com/)
* MATLAB 2011a (32 bit) (untested on later versions)
* Symphony UI (the package containing this document)

For 32 bit Windows 7 you also need:

* HEKA ITC-18 drivers (32 bit)

For 64 bit Windows 7 you also need:

* HEKA ITC-18 drivers (64 bit)

The HEKA drivers are available at http://www.heka.com/download/download.html in the "EPC/PG Drivers" 
section.

Using Symphony with 64 bit Windows has not been extensively tested.  It is recommend to stay with 
32 bit at this point.


Installing Symphony for development
-----------------------------------

Symphony can be installed on any Windows or Mac in order to develop protocols, figure handlers, etc.  
To do this the following items need to be installed:

* MATLAB 2011a (32 bit)
* Symphony .NET Framework (if on Windows, available from http://download.physionconsulting.com/)
* Symphony UI (the package containing this document)


Configuring Symphony
--------------------

Copy the symconfig.m script from the Symphony UI directory into the MATLAB user path directory.  
Edit the copied configuration script to define the location of rig configurations, protocols, etc.

The MATLAB user path can be determined by running the userpath function at the MATLAB command line.
