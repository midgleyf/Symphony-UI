Rig Configurations
==================

The Symphony UI provides a base class for defining "rig configurations" which describe how a rig is wired.  
A rig configuration consists of some number of devices, each of which has an input and/or output stream.  
In a typical physiology rig, each amplifier channel, any stimulation devices such as an LED, valve, etc., 
would be represented by a distinct device.  See the Symphony .NET documentation [1] for more details.


Defining a new rig configuration
--------------------------------

To define a new rig configuration you need to create a sub-class of the RigConfiguration class.  

Your sub-class should:
1. Uniquely identify the configuration.
2. Override the createDevices() methods.


Identifying the configuration
-----------------------------

Identify the configuration using constant properties of the RigConfiguration sub-class.

    properties (Constant)
        displayName = 'My Configuration'
    end


Adding a MultiClamp device
--------------------------

To add a MultiClamp device use the addMultiClampDevice() convenience method and supply the name for 
the device, the channel to use and the names of the output and input streams.  Use an empty string 
to indicate that no output or input stream should be used.

Example:

    obj.addMultiClampDevice('MC Channel 1', 1, 'ANALOG_OUT.0', 'ANALOG_IN.0');


Adding other devices
--------------------

To add a non-MultiClamp device use the addDevice() convenience method and supply the name for the 
device and the names of the output and input streams.  Use an empty string to indicate that no 
output or input stream should be used.

Example:

    obj.addDevice('LED', 'ANALOG_OUT.1', '');   % output only

	
Saving rig configurations
-------------------------

Symphony will search for rig configurations in the directory defined by the rigConfigsDir variable in the
SymphonyConfiguration.m script. All rig configurations must be at the top level of the rig configurations directory.
	
	
A simple configuration
----------------------

The following class implements a simple configuration which has one MultiClamp device and one other device.

class SimpleRig < RigConfiguration
    properties (Constant)
        displayName = 'Simple Rig'
    end
    
    methods
        function createDevices(obj)
            obj.addMultiClampDevice('MC Channel 1', 1, 'ANALOG_OUT.0', 'ANALOG_IN.0');
            obj.addDevice('LED', 'ANALOG_OUT.1', '');   % output only
        end
    end
end


Sample rate
-----------

Each rig configuration has a sample rate that is shared across all of its devices.  Currently the Symphony 
.NET framework does not support different rates for different devices though this may change in the future.
Typically the sample rate is set by the user when defining a protocol's parameters but you could preset the 
rate by adding the following code to your sub-class' createDevices method:

    obj.sampleRate = 20000;
