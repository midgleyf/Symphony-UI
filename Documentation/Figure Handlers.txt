Figure Handlers
===============

The Symphony UI provides a number of pre-built classes for displaying different types of figures.  A protocol can 
open one of the figure windows using the openFigure() method from the SymphonyProtocol base class.


Response figure
---------------

This figure plots the response from the most recent epoch.  No arguments are required.  If there is more than one 
device with a response, however, the device name containing the response to plot should be specified.

Example:

    obj.openFigure('Response');
	obj.openFigure('Response', 'Amplifier_Ch1');


Mean Response figure
--------------------

This figure displays the mean response of all epochs run so far.  The epochs are grouped by a set of parameters and 
the mean of each group is plotted.  The grouping parameters can be specified using the 'GroupByParams' argument or 
they will be determined automatically.  The device name containing the response can also be specified as the second 
argument.

Examples:

    obj.openFigure('Mean Response');
    obj.openFigure('Mean Response', 'GroupByParams', {'param1', 'param2'});
	obj.openFigure('Mean Response', 'Amplifier_Ch1');


Response Statistics figure
--------------------------

This figure plots statistics for each epoch that has been run.  A callback function must be provided that returns a 
structure containing the statistics for the current epoch.  The response() method can be called to get the response 
of the most recent epoch.

Example:
    
    functions s = stats(obj)
        % Provide statistics for the current epoch.
        r = obj.response();
        
        s.mean = mean(r);
        s.var = var(r);
    end
    
    function prepareRun(obj)
        % ... call base method, other setup, etc. ...
        
        obj.openFigure('Response Statistics', 'StatsCallback', @stats);
    end


Custom figure
-------------

This figure simply opens an empty axes and calls back to the protocol after each epoch is run to allow updates.

Example:

    functions updateFigure(obj, axesHandle)
        % Update the title with the current epoch number.
        title(axesHandle, ['Epoch ' str2num(obj.epochNum)]);
    end
    
    function prepareRun(obj)
        % ... call base method, other setup, etc. ...
        
        obj.openFigure('Custom', 'Name', 'Custom Plot', ...
                                 'UpdateCallback', @updateFigure);
    end
